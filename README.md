Hey! My home server setup is mostly managed with a docker-compose.yml file, along with some scripts and crontab entries for maintenance.
The hardware is a Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB of RAM — surprisingly more than enough to substitute a server.
The repo is pretty messy, but it’s kept things in check and it's running smoothly for years.
Feel free to use this repo as inspiration for your own ideas.

P.S. I do need to update the hardware and set up NixOS tho...
